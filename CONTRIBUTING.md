Workflow
--------

Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

* Fork the project.
* Clone down your fork ( `git clone git@github.com:[username]/fear-core-serve.git` ).
* Create a topic branch to contain your change ( `git checkout -b my_awesome_feature` ).
* Hack away, add tests. Not necessarily in that order.
* Make sure everything still passes by running `npm run test`.
* If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
* Push the branch up ( `git push origin my_awesome_feature` ).
* Create a pull request against fear-core-serve/develop and describe what your change
  does and the why you think it should be merged.
